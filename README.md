# Anti-Gravity-Demonstration

This project will attemp to replicate Dr. Woodwards laboratory results where he showed that mass and therefore weight can be altered 
in the laboratory by rapidly changing the energy in an accelerating capacitance device as predected by the Mach Effect. This demonstrates
an anti-gravity effect in the sense that the device weight reduces during some stages of the experiment. It should be noted that DR. Woodward and in fact no physicist has used the anti-gravity phrase.
