# Anti-Gravity-Demonstration

This project will attemp to replicate Dr. Woodwards laboratory results, without benefit of vacuum where he showed that mass and therefore weight can be altered in the laboratory by changing the energy in an accelerating capacitance device as predected by the Mach Effect. This is proposed by DR Woodward due to Einsteins second law, M = E/C^2. It demonstrates an anti-gravity effect in the sense that the weight of the device decreases during some stages of the experiment and increases in others. It should be noted that DR. Woodward and in fact no physicist has used the term "anti-gravity". The cost of all the parts for this demonstration is kept to a minimum.

The demonstration requires:
1. A pizoelectric device to store and release energy.
2. A method of briefly accelerating the device.
3. A method of delivering power accurately to the device.
4. A scale or some way to accuratly measure the device weight to +/- .25 mgrams.
5. Computers and software to control and monitor the experiment.

# Software

All software to run this experiment will be located here on Github. Please excuse my spaghetti code as I'm not a programmer. It's not pretty. 

The mechanical scale is a simple load cell connected to an NAU7802 data collecting module. The program to acquire data and FFT it is in the NAU7802 portion.
