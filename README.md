# Anti-Gravity-Demonstration

This project will attemp to replicate Dr. Woodwards laboratory results without benefit of vacuum where he showed that mass and therefore weight can be altered in the laboratory by changing the energy in an accelerating capacitance device as predected by the Mach Effect. This is proposed by DR Woodward due to Einsteins second law, M = E/C^2. It demonstrates an anti-gravity effect in the sense that the devices weight reduces during some stages of the experiment. It should be noted that DR. Woodward and in fact no physicist has used the term "anti-gravity".

The demonstration requires
